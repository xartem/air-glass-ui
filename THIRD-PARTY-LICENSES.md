# Third-Party Licenses — Air Glass UI

This template bundles open-source software, a font, and static assets created by third
parties. Each is the property of its respective author(s) and is used here under the
license listed below. Their copyright and permission notices are reproduced in this file
as required by those licenses.

This document is separate from, and does not override, the template's own license — see
**[LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md)**.

## Compliance summary

The full dependency tree (709 installed packages) and every shipped font and asset were
audited for resale eligibility under Envato's licensing rules.

- **Verdict: PASS.** No shipped component uses a resale-incompatible license.
- **Zero** GPL / LGPL / AGPL / other strong copyleft, **zero** non-commercial
  (`CC-BY-NC`) terms, and **zero** "no-redistribution / evaluation-only" clauses were
  found.
- Every runtime dependency is permissive: **MIT**, **ISC**, **Apache-2.0**, or **BSD**.
- The bundled font (Geist) is **SIL OFL 1.1**, which permits bundling and sale *with*
  software (it only forbids selling the font by itself).
- A handful of build-time-only tooling licenses (MPL-2.0, CC-BY-4.0, CC0-1.0,
  Python-2.0, MIT-0, BlueOak-1.0.0) appear in the dependency tree; these packages are
  **not** part of the buyer's shipped bundle. See
  [Build-time-only licenses](#build-time-only-licenses-not-shipped).

> **License texts:** the full text of every license referenced below is included in
> [License texts](#license-texts) at the end of this file. A verbatim copy of each
> dependency's own `LICENSE` file also ships inside its `node_modules/<pkg>` folder.

### Notable bundled transitive dependencies

These are pulled in by the packages above and can end up in the shipped bundle:

| Package | Version | License | Copyright / Attribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `victory-vendor` | 37.3.6 | MIT AND ISC | Copyright (c) Formidable — re-bundles D3 modules (`d3-scale`, `d3-shape`, etc.; BSD-3-Clause / ISC / MIT). Pulled in by `recharts`. |
| `tslib` | 2.8.1 | 0BSD | Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation — TypeScript runtime helpers. 0BSD requires no attribution. |

---

## Dev & tooling dependencies (build-time only — NOT redistributed)

These packages are declared in `package.json` → `devDependencies`. They run at build,
test, and lint time only and are **not** part of the buyer's shipped bundle. They are
listed here for transparency; they do not gate resale.

| Package | Version | License | Copyright / Attribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@testing-library/react` | 16.3.2 | MIT | Copyright (c) 2017-present Kent C. Dodds |

| `vitest` | 4.1.9 | MIT | Copyright (c) 2021-present VoidZero Inc. and Vitest contributors |

### Build-time-only licenses (not shipped)

The transitive tree of the tooling above contains a few non-MIT licenses. Every one of
these packages runs only during build/lint/test and is **not** included in the buyer's
production output, so none affects resale:

| Package(s) | License | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lightningcss`, `lightningcss-darwin-arm64` | MPL-2.0 | CSS transform/minify used by the build. File-level copyleft; redistribution permitted; not shipped. |
| `caniuse-lite` | CC-BY-4.0 | Browser-support data (Browserslist). Attribution-only; build-time data. |
| `mdn-data` | CC0-1.0 | CSS metadata (public domain). Build-time only. |
| `argparse` | Python-2.0 | Transitive of a YAML parser. Permissive; build-time only. |
| `@csstools/color-helpers`, `@csstools/css-syntax-patches-for-csstree` | MIT-0 | MIT without the attribution clause. Build-time only. |
| `isexe`, `lru-cache`, `minimatch` | BlueOak-1.0.0 | Permissive; build/CLI tooling. Not shipped. |

## Fonts

### Geist Variable

- **Package:** `@fontsource-variable/geist` 5.2.9
- **License:** SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1 (`OFL-1.1`)
- **Imported by:** `src/index.css` (`@import "@fontsource-variable/geist";`) and used via
  the `--font-sans: 'Geist Variable'` design token.
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2024 The Geist Project Authors
  (<https://github.com/vercel/geist-font>)

**OFL compliance for this template:**

- The OFL **permits** bundling, embedding, redistributing, and selling the font *together
  with software* (such as this template). ✔
- The OFL **forbids** selling the font **by itself** — this template never does that. ✔
- The OFL **requires** that the copyright notice and the full license text travel with
  the font. The verbatim OFL 1.1 text and the Geist copyright are reproduced below and in
  [License texts](#license-texts); the license also ships inside
  `node_modules/@fontsource-variable/geist/LICENSE`. Ensure the license notice remains
  present alongside the font files in the delivered package. ✔
- The **Reserved Font Name** is "Geist" — do not release a *modified* version of the font
  under that name. This template uses the font unmodified, so no restriction applies. ✔

The full verbatim OFL 1.1 license block (with the Geist copyright header) is included
under [SIL Open Font License 1.1](#sil-open-font-license-11).

## Static assets

| Asset | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public/favicon.svg` | **Shipped — original artwork** | Bespoke "Air Glass" brand mark (custom geometric glyph); © the template author. Not a third-party icon set; no attribution required. |

### Removed / not shipped

During the audit, the following assets were **removed** from the template because they
were either third-party trademarked artwork or of unverifiable provenance, and none were
referenced by the application:

| Asset (removed) | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `src/assets/vite.svg` | The Vite logo — a trademark of the Vite project. Not resale-safe as bundled artwork; was unused. |
| `public/icons.svg` | A sprite of third-party brand icons (Bluesky, Discord, GitHub, X/Twitter). Brand trademarks / unverifiable icon-set provenance; was unused. |
| `src/assets/hero.png` | Decorative hero illustration with unverifiable provenance. Removed rather than shipped without a clear license; was unused. |

All application icons used at runtime come from `lucide-react` (ISC), which is documented
above.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Geist-Italic[wght].ttf: Copyright 2024 The Geist Project Authors (https://github.com/vercel/geist-font)

This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
http://scripts.sil.org/OFL


-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:
